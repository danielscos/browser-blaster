# Browser Blaster

To use this Chrome Extention, open chrome or a chromium browser, go to extensions, enable developer mode if needed, and load the folder project into the extensions page.
Next use the toolbar to blast your browser.

Once it's set up you will see the effect (very clearly) once you type anything on the search bar and hit enter.
